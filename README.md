# Gravitational-Slingshots-Effects
An interactive Python simulation of the gravitational slingshot effect, where a ship interacts with a planetâ€™s gravity. Users can adjust parameters like gravitational constant (G), planet mass, and ship mass to observe how trajectories and forces change dynamically.
